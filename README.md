# mlops_app
This repository presents the web application side using the model developed in [Spaceship Titanic Classifier Model](https://github.com/kojr1234/mlops_exercise). All api functionalities are implemented in this repository.

Web application to make use of the classificartion model as API
This repository presents my learnings on model deployment and software development best practices in the context of machine learning. This project aims to exercise concepts such as testing, model packaging, tooling, etc. The reference I am using comes from the repository of the course [Deployment of Machine Learning Models](https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/)

The project comprises the following tools:

tox
pytest
setuptools
fastapi
uvicorn
heroku
For future improvements, I will add docker support and models as API.
